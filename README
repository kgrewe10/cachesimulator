----- Cache Simulator V1 with Prefetcher ----- 
-----------Created By Kyle Grewe--------------
----------------------------------------------

-Built on 64 Bit Linux
-Platform independent if JVM is installed.

READ BEFORE RUNNING APPLICATION:

1. To run the cache simulator you must have a JVM installed on the system.  Once the JVM is installed, you may proceed.

2. The executable JAR file CacheSimulator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar is located in /target directory along with the trace.din and memory traces from linpack and dhrystone as linpacktrace.out and dhrystonetrace.out.

3. java -jar [jarfile] [arg1] [arg2]... etc. is the format to run the jar.

4. To enter the help menu: java -jar CacheSimulator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar help

5. This application takes in 6 or 8 arguments in order as specified below.  Order matters.

6. |||Determine how you want to run||| 6 arguments: cache simulation, 8 arguments: cache simulation with prefetcher

ARGUMENTS FORMAT

[type] [cachesize] [blocksize] [associativity] [inputfilename] [outputfilename] OPTIONAL [prefetchbuffer] [confidencebits]

type: The type of cache - split or unified.
     values: s = split, u = unified
cachesize: The total cache size in bytes.
     values: any multiple of two
blocksize: The block size for each block in the cache in bytes.
     values: any multiple of two
associativity: The associativity of the cache.  Use 1 for direct mapped.
     values: any multiple of two
inputfilename: The name of the input file to use for the simulation.
     values: a string
outputfilename: The name of the output file to create with results.
     values: a string

-----------------------------------------
OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
-----------------------------------------

prefetchbuffer: The size of the prefetcher memory.
     values: any multiple of two
confidencebits: The number of bits to use to determine confidence.
     values: 2 or 3

*******EXAMPLE CONSOLE INPUT*******
[CACHE SIM ONLY]
Example 1: java -jar CacheSimulator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar u 16384 32 4 linpacktrace.out linpackresults
	Simulates a unified 16K cache with block size of 32 and associativity of 4.  
	Input file is the linpacktrace.out and linpackresults is the output filename.

Example 2: java -jar CacheSimulator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar s 32768 32 4 linpacktrace.out linpackresults
	Simulates a split cache each with size 16K, block size of 32 and associativity of 4. 
	Input file is the linpacktrace.out and linpackresults is the output filename.
	 
[CACHE SIM WITH PREFETCHER]
Example 1: java -jar CacheSimulator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar u 16384 32 4 dhrystonetrace.out dryresults 4096 2
	Simulates a unified 16K cache with block size of 32 and associativity of 4.
	Prefetcher enabled buffer size 4096 and 2 confidence bits.
	Input file is the dhrystonetrace.out and dryresults is the output filename.
	
Example 2: java -jar CacheSimulator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar u 16384 32 4 linpacktrace.out linresults 2048 3
	Simulates a unified 16K cache with block size of 32 and associativity of 4.
	Prefetcher enabled buffer size 2048 and 3 confidence bits.
	Input file is the linpacktrace.out and linresults is the output filename.

5. LRU replacement policy is assumed.

6. If a split cache is specified, the input block size and associativity will be used for both caches and input cache size will be split and two and used as each split caches size.
